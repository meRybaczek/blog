Electric, electronic, colorimetric enthusiast and engaged to Java programming recently ;)

### More Information

The idea for a blog came about when, once again, I was taking notes on the topic I was studying, which was Java programming. I decided to start sharing some of my thoughts directly on the blog. I'm aware of my limited experience as a programmer, so I might not have fully understood some concepts correctly. If you'd like, please write and explain any potential errors, and I will definitely correct the article.
